# The following system calls allows memfsd to run.  - This list should
# probably be paired down further or limited based on arguments.
#
# Don't allow "openat because this would allow a process to read
# local resources. For example, adding it would enable fsuxd to work,
# and we want arbitrary processes not to read/write local files.
#
# allow exit_group() to exit a process. don't use _exit because it
# just terminates a thread.
